# JosnLibMod
Thank you for using Wisadell's JsonLib! I am making this mod to add more diversity to Jsonmods! If you need to know the parameters of new types and blocks, please feel free to check the new. txt file in your code!
# Usage method 1 (recommended):
Put the "lib", "org" folders and "classes. dex" files into your mod, Add "java: true" and "main: lib.LibMod" in "mod.json"
